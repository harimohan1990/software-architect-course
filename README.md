## 🧠 **1. What is Software Architecture?**

Software architecture is the **high-level structure of a software system**, outlining:

* The **components** (services, databases, APIs)
* The **relationships** between them
* The **principles** guiding their design and evolution

### ✅ Key Responsibilities:

* Ensure **scalability**
* Enable **maintainability**
* Guarantee **reliability**
* Align with **business goals**

> “Architecture is about the **important stuff**—whatever that is.” — Ralph Johnson

---

## 🔍 **2. Why is Architecture Required?**

### 🎯 Goals of Good Architecture:

* Avoid bottlenecks & single points of failure
* Define system **boundaries** and **communication protocols**
* Promote **separation of concerns**
* Enable **team collaboration** and distributed development

### Without Architecture:

* Systems become **fragile**, **inflexible**, and **hard to scale**

---

## ⚖️ **3. Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling**

### 🔼 Vertical Scaling

* Add more power (CPU, RAM) to a **single machine**
* Simple but **limited** by hardware
* Example: Upgrading a server from 16 GB RAM to 64 GB RAM

### 🔁 Horizontal Scaling

* Add **more servers** to the pool
* Enables **distributed systems**
* Example: Deploying your service across multiple VMs or containers

| Feature         | Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling            |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ease of Setup   | Easier           | Complex (needs orchestration) |
| Limitations     | Hardware limits  | More flexible                 |
| Fault Tolerance | Low              | High                          |

---

## 🌐 **4. Why Do We Need Distributed Systems?**

### 🌟 Benefits:

* **Scalability**: Handle millions of users
* **Fault Tolerance**: One node fails, others continue
* **Geographic Distribution**: Serve users across the world
* **Performance**: Reduced latency by placing nodes closer to users

> Ex: Netflix distributes video files using **CDNs and microservices** globally.

---

## 🧩 **5. CAP Theorem**

**CAP = Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance**
A distributed system can only guarantee **2 out of 3**.

| Property                    | Description                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Consistency (C)**         | All nodes return the same data                   |
| **Availability (A)**        | System continues to operate                      |
| **Partition Tolerance (P)** | System works even if network fails between nodes |

### CAP Examples:

* **CP System**: MongoDB (prioritizes Consistency)
* **AP System**: Couchbase (prioritizes Availability)
* **CA System**: Traditional RDBMS (only in single-node systems)

---

## 🧪 **6. ACID Properties (DB Transactions)**

Ensures **reliable transactions** in databases:

* **Atomicity**: All steps succeed or none
* **Consistency**: Valid data only
* **Isolation**: Transactions don’t interfere
* **Durability**: Once committed, data is saved

> Ex: Online bank transfer — money shouldn’t leave account A without arriving at B.

---

## 📊 **7. Common Terms**

| Term             | Meaning                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**      | Time taken to process a single request         |
| **Throughput**   | Number of requests processed per unit time     |
| **Availability** | Uptime guarantee of the system (e.g., 99.999%) |

### 🧮 Example:

A web API with:

* Latency = 100ms
* Throughput = 10,000 req/s
* Availability = 99.99% (about 4.38 min/month downtime)

Here’s a detailed **tutorial** on **High Availability Architecture** and **Replication Strategies**:

---

## 🏗️ **1. What is High Availability (HA)?**

**High Availability** ensures that a system is **continuously operational** for a **long duration** with minimal downtime.

### 🎯 Key Goals:

* Tolerate hardware/software failures
* Provide **automatic failover**
* Serve users **without disruption**

> Uptime targets:

* **99.9%** → \~8.8 hours/year downtime
* **99.99%** → \~52 mins/year
* **99.999% (Five Nines)** → \~5 mins/year

---

## 🔐 **2. HA Architecture Principles**

### ✅ Techniques:

* **Redundant Servers**: No single point of failure
* **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across healthy nodes
* **Failover Systems**: Auto-switch to backup on failure
* **Health Checks**: Monitor node status
* **Distributed Databases**: Replicated data ensures availability

---

## 🔄 **3. What is Replication?**

**Replication** is the process of copying and maintaining database/data copies **across multiple servers or locations**.

> Purpose: Improve **availability**, **fault-tolerance**, and **read scalability**

---

## 📂 **4. Types of Replication Consistency Models**

---

### 🔷 A. **Strong Consistency**

#### 🧠 What is it?

* Every read receives the **most recent write**.

#### ✅ Pros:

* Guarantees data correctness
* Simplifies developer logic

#### ❌ Cons:

* **Latency can increase**
* Less tolerant to network partition

#### 🔧 Use cases:

* Banking systems
* Inventory management

#### 🧪 Example:

```txt
User 1 writes: Balance = ₹1000
User 2 reads immediately: Gets ₹1000 (latest)
```

---

### 🔷 B. **Weak Consistency**

#### 🧠 What is it?

* No guarantee that a read will return the latest write.
* Focus is on **availability over accuracy**.

#### ✅ Pros:

* Very fast reads
* High availability

#### ❌ Cons:

* Can read stale data

#### 🔧 Use cases:

* Monitoring dashboards
* News feed previews

#### 🧪 Example:

```txt
User 1 writes: "Price = ₹500"
User 2 reads: Might see old price "₹450"
```

---

### 🔷 C. **Eventual Consistency**

#### 🧠 What is it?

* Over time, **all nodes converge to the same value**.
* Most common model in distributed systems.

#### ✅ Pros:

* High availability
* Scales easily

#### ❌ Cons:

* Requires conflict resolution
* Harder for developers to reason about

#### 🔧 Use cases:

* DNS
* Social networks
* E-commerce carts

#### 🧪 Example:

```txt
Writes propagate gradually...
User in India may see update after 2 seconds, US after 4 seconds.
Eventually both see same value.
```

## 🔄 **Replication Strategies**

| Strategy          | Description                              | Example Systems     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Master-Slave**  | One primary node, multiple read replicas | MySQL, PostgreSQL   |
| **Master-Master** | Multiple writable nodes                  | Cassandra, ActiveMQ |
| **Quorum-Based**  | Read/Write only after majority agrees    | DynamoDB            |

---

## 💡 Design Best Practices

* Use **quorum reads/writes** for balance between consistency and availability.
* Replicate across **geographic regions** to reduce latency.
* Implement **conflict resolution** strategies (timestamps, version vectors).
* Use **automated failover tools** (e.g., AWS Route 53, Consul, Zookeeper).

## 📌 Summary

| Model    | Guarantees        | Trade-off                      |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Strong   | Latest data       | Higher latency, less available |
| Weak     | Fast access       | Possibly stale data            |
| Eventual | Converging values | Temporary inconsistency        |


Here's a deep tutorial on **Advanced Data Structures** for Software Architects with a focus on **LRU Cache**, **Graph Data Structures**, and **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Dig Ikra)**:

---

## 🧠 1. **LRU Cache (Least Recently Used)**

### 📌 What is LRU Cache?

An **LRU cache** discards the **least recently used** items first when it runs out of space.

### 🧱 Ideal for:

* Systems with **limited memory**
* **Caching layers** (e.g., browser history, database query results)

### ⚙️ Core Idea:

Keep track of recently accessed data using:

* **HashMap** for O(1) lookup
* **Doubly Linked List** to reorder usage

### 🧪 Example:

```txt
Cache Size = 3

Access Order: A → B → C → A → D
Cache Status: [A, D, C]  // B is evicted (least recently used)
```

### 🔧 Used in:

* Redis, Memcached
* CDN Edge Caches
* Operating system page replacement

---

## 🌐 2. **Graph Data Structures**

### 📌 Why Graphs Matter for Architects:

* They represent **relationships** and **networks**
* Used in **routing**, **dependency resolution**, **recommendation engines**, etc.

### 🧱 Key Concepts:

* **Nodes (Vertices)**: Entities
* **Edges**: Connections (can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted)

### 📚 Representations:

* **Adjacency List**: Efficient for sparse graphs
* **Adjacency Matrix**: Good for dense graphs

---

### 🔧 Use Cases in System Design:

* **Social Graph**: Facebook friend recommendations
* **Service Dependencies**: Microservice call graphs
* **Navigation/Maps**: Google Maps routing
* **Knowledge Graphs**: For semantic search and AI

---

## 📍 3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Dig Ikra)**

### 📌 Purpose:

Find the **shortest path** from a source node to all other nodes in a **weighted graph with non-negative edges**.

### 🧠 How It Works:

1. Initialize all node distances as `∞`, source as `0`.
2. Use a **min-priority queue** to explore nearest unvisited node.
3. Update distances to adjacent nodes if shorter paths are found.
4. Repeat until all nodes are visited.

### 🧪 Example:

```txt
A --1--> B --3--> D
A --4--> C --1--> D

Shortest Path A → D = A → B → D = 1+3 = 4
```

### 🔧 Used in:

* **Google Maps**, **Uber routing**
* **Network routing protocols** (OSPF)
* **Recommendation engines** with weights

---

## 🧱 Why These Are Critical for Architects

| Structure | Purpose                                 | Real-World Use                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| LRU Cache | Speed up access to frequently used data | Memory cache, API cache       |
| Graph     | Model relationships                     | Social networks, dependencies |
| Dijkstra  | Optimize traversal/pathfinding          | Maps, routing, delivery apps  |

Here’s a deep and practical tutorial on **Load Balancers** for Software Architects, covering all major types:

---

## 🧠 **1. What is a Load Balancer?**

A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers to:

#### 🧪 Example:

```txt
Requests → S1 → S2 → S3 → S1 → ...
```

#### 🔧 Use Case:

* Stateless apps with similar server performance
* Easy to implement

#### ❌ Limitations:

* Doesn’t consider server health or load

---

### 🌐 B. **DNS Load Balancer**

#### ✅ How It Works:

* Uses **DNS records (A or CNAME)** to distribute requests to multiple IP addresses.

#### 🔧 Use Case:

* **Global traffic distribution**
* **CDNs**

#### ❌ Limitations:

* **DNS caching** causes stale routing
* Doesn’t support real-time failover

---

### 🧱 C. **Layer-4 Load Balancer (Transport Layer)**

* Fast and lightweight

#### 🔧 Use Case:

* Load balancing **databases**, **WebSockets**, **FTP**, etc.

#### Tools:

* HAProxy (Layer 4 mode), NGINX (stream module)

---

### 📦 D. **Layer-7 Load Balancer (Application Layer)**

#### ✅ How It Works:

* Makes decisions based on **HTTP headers**, **URLs**, **cookies**, etc.

#### 🧪 Example:

```txt
/api → microservice-A
/user → microservice-B
```

#### 🔧 Use Case:

* **Microservices**
* **REST APIs**
* **Advanced routing (A/B testing, geo-routing)**

#### Tools:

* AWS ALB, Envoy, NGINX, Traefik

---

### ♻️ E. **Consistent Hashing Load Balancer**

#### ✅ How It Works:

* Hashes request keys (e.g., user ID, session) to specific servers on a ring.
* **Only a few keys move** when a server is added or removed.

#### 🔧 Use Case:

* **Distributed caches** (e.g., Memcached)
* **Sharded databases**
* **Session stickiness**

#### Advantages:

* Predictable routing
* Great for **stateful systems**

> 💡 Think of API Gateway as a **reverse proxy + policy engine** for microservices.

---

## 🌐 **3. REST APIs in Microservices**

Each microservice exposes **RESTful endpoints** like:

```
GET /users/123
POST /orders
PUT /products/sku123
```

### 🧱 Best Practices:

* Use **resource-oriented** URIs
* Follow **HTTP verbs** meaningfully
* Implement **versioning** (e.g., /api/v1/)
* Return **standard status codes**
* Use **OpenAPI/Swagger** for documentation

> REST APIs enable **interoperability** between services, teams, and technologies.

## 📈 **4. Microservices Scaling**

### 🚀 Horizontal Scaling

* Deploy **multiple instances** of each microservice
* Load balance requests using **Layer-7 LB** or **Service Mesh**

### ⚙️ Tools:

* **Docker** (packaging)
* **Kubernetes** (orchestration, autoscaling)
* **ECS/EKS** on AWS, **AKS** on Azure

### 💡 Advanced Strategies:

* **Event-driven scaling** (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
* **Function-based scaling** (e.g., AWS Lambda for stateless tasks)

---

## 🔐 **5. Microservices Security**

### 🧱 Challenges:

* More entry points → More attack surface
* Internal service communication must be secured

### ✅ Techniques:

* **OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect** for user authentication
* **JWT Tokens** for service-to-service auth
* **TLS encryption** (service mesh often handles it)
* **API Rate Limiting** and **Throttling**
* **Zero Trust Security** with service identity

## 🧾 **6. Microservices Best Practices**

| Practice                          | Why It Matters                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Single Responsibility per Service | Easier to develop, test, and deploy                |
| Decentralized Data Management     | Avoids single DB bottleneck; enhances independence |
| CI/CD Pipelines per Service       | Enables frequent and safe deployments              |
| Monitoring & Observability        | Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack      |
| Circuit Breakers & Retry Logic    | Prevent cascading failures                         |
| Service Mesh                      | Automates security, retries, telemetry             |
| API Versioning                    | Prevents breaking clients during upgrades          |
| Health Checks & Auto-healing      | Ensures resilience via orchestrators               |

## 🔁 Real World Example (Netflix)

Netflix has:

* 1000s of microservices
* Custom API Gateway (Zuul, now evolved)
* Uses **Eureka** for service discovery
* Relies on **Hystrix** (circuit breakers), **Kafka**, **Spinnaker** for CI/CD

Here’s a **deep dive tutorial** on **Security in Microservices via API Rate Limiting**—crucial for protecting cloud-native systems from abuse, DoS attacks, and traffic spikes.

---

## 🔐 **1. Why Rate Limiting in Microservices?**

Rate limiting helps to:

* **Prevent abuse** (brute force, bot attacks)
* Ensure **fair usage**
* **Protect downstream services**
* Enable **SLA enforcement** and **billing models**

---

## 📊 **2. Categories of API Rate Limiting**

---

### 🧍 A. **User Rate Limiting**

* Restricts how many requests a **user** can make in a time frame.
* Example: 100 requests/minute per user

> 🛡 Prevents a single user from hogging resources.

---

### 🧵 B. **Concurrency Rate Limiting**

* Limits how many **simultaneous requests** a user/session/API can make.
* Example: Only 5 concurrent file uploads per user.

> ⛔ Blocks excessive parallelism to avoid CPU spikes.

---

### 🌍 C. **Location & ID Rate Limiting**

* Applies different limits based on **geo-location**, **IP**, or **user ID**.
* Example: Limit 10 logins/min from the same IP

> 🛡 Useful for **regional abuse detection** and **IP blacklisting**.

---

### 🖥️ D. **Server Rate Limiting**

* Global limit on the **server’s capacity** to accept requests.
* Example: Reject requests if server CPU is above 80%

> 📉 Protects service health under high load.

---

### ⚙️ E. **Priority Session Rate Limiting**

* Assigns different limits based on **user type** (premium vs. free).
* Example: Free users get 10 requests/sec, Premium get 100

> 💰 Enables monetization and SLA enforcement.

---

### 🚫 F. **Drop Low Priority Sessions**

* Automatically drop or throttle low-priority sessions **under stress**.

> 🚨 Emergency tactic to maintain system availability for high-priority users.

---

## 🪣 **3. Rate Limiting Algorithms**

---

### 1️⃣ **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**

* Requests go into a **bucket with constant leak rate**
* Smoothens bursts by draining requests at a steady rate

> Ideal for maintaining a **consistent request flow**

---

### 2️⃣ **Token Bucket Algorithm**

* Tokens are added at a constant rate
* Each request **consumes a token**
* If no tokens: request is **denied or queued**

> ✅ Allows **burst traffic** up to a limit, great for real APIs

---

### 3️⃣ **Fixed Window Algorithm**

* Limits are based on fixed time slots (e.g., per minute)
* Simple to implement

> ❌ Can cause burst at window boundary (e.g., 100 requests at 59th second)

---

### 4️⃣ **Sliding Window Algorithm**

* Maintains request log and computes usage over a **rolling window**
* More accurate and fairer than fixed window

> ✅ Smooths burst better and avoids spikes

---
